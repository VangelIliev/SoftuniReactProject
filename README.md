This is my Software University React Project.It is about cooking recipies.
Guests can only View all of the recipes and filter them by category.
Users (Registered) can view all recipes, add a recipe but only modify and delete their own recipies.
For client side routing I have used React Router.
For the components I have used functional components with React Hooks like useState, useEffect, useNavigate......
For Authentication I have used Firebase.
The data about the recipes and the users is stored in Firebase Firestore.
For styling I have used css modules for each different component.
Every input has a client side validation so we don't send wrong data to firebase.
For global state I have used context API.
